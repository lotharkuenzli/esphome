# ESPHome External Components

## Usage
[See here for how to use external components](https://esphome.io/components/external_components.html).


## Koch TC:Bus / TCS intercom Interface
Easily receive doorbells and send door opening commands.

### Hardware
The code has been written on a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8260).

Straightforward IO-schematics:
![IO-Schematics](tc_bus_transceiver_schematics.jpg?raw=true)

Beware:
- The output circuit only works due to the very short (some milliseconds) activation periods. Both the resistor and transistor will be damaged if turned on _permanently_ for longer than ~15 milliseconds!
- The input circuit reliably detects low for bus voltages < ~12V and high for bus voltages > ~22V.

See this repo for a good explanation on how the bus actually works: https://github.com/atc1441/TCSintercomArduino/blob/master/README.md


### Configuration
Get the proper message data by pressing the actual doorbell and door open buttons of your door control and looking at the log. E.g.
- `0x1100` is usually the generic open door command message.
- A doorbell message looks like `0x432180` where `0x4321` (`17185` in decimal, usually written on the back of the device) would be the address of the door control unit in your flat.

The following example configuration:
- creates a lock-entity in HomeAssistant which sends the configured open door command message upon "OPEN".
- creates a event-entity in HomeAssistant which would receive an event when one of the configure messages has been seen on the bus.
- change the input and output pins according to your hardware.
